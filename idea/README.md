About
---------------

[ASPSecurityKit](https://ASPSecurityKit.net/) (ASK for short) enables developers rapidly build secure web apps/APIs based on zero trust principle, without security experience. It's  the first true Zero Trust framework for .NET.

ASK unifies multiple security checks such as authentication, two-factor, authorization, account verification, suspension, firewall into an extendable pipeline with ADA as its killer feature.

ASK also provides supplementary products called source packages, that give source implementation of profile/user management/admin portals and APIs, built on ASK framework, to save time developing these from scratch, enabling teams to get started with business features of the prototype/product.

ASK encourages low-code for security by automating several key checks as even competent devs without a coherent security framework make silly security errors because the mindset is driven by end-user convenience.

ASK has proven itself in ISCP – a financial API platform – that manages over 1.3m IRA accounts and $13 billion IRA assets, which had an independent pentest performed by BHIS.
