A customer relationship management (CRM) software is primarily used to manage contacts (customers) and the interactions with them. This sample demonstrates a multi-tenant API service that allows two types of users – individual and business (team) – to setup account and perform CRUD operations related to contacts and interactions in isolation (each account is only limited to seeing and modifying data that belongs to it).
